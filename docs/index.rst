**Documentation Version:** |release|

`TensorLayerX`_ is a deep learning library designed for researchers and engineers that is compatible with multiple deep learning frameworks
such as TensorFlow, MindSpore and PaddlePaddle, allowing users to run the code on different hardware like Nvidia-GPU and Huawei-Ascend.
It provides popular DL and RL modules that can be easily customized and assembled for tackling real-world machine learning problems.
More details can be found `here <https://github.com/tensorlayer/TensorLayerX>`_.

TensorLayerX is a multi-backend AI framework, which can run on almost all operation systems and AI hardwares, and support hybrid-framework programming. The currently version supports TensorFlow, MindSpore, PaddlePaddle and PyTorch(partial) as the backends.

.. note::
   If you got problem to read the docs online, you could download the repository
   on `TensorLayerX`_, then go to ``/docs/_build/html/index.html`` to read the docs
   offline. The ``_build`` folder can be generated in ``docs`` using ``make html``.

User Guide
------------

The TensorLayerX user guide explains how to install TensorFlow, CUDA and cuDNN,
how to build and train neural networks using TensorLayer3, and how to contribute
to the library as a developer.
