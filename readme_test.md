# TensorLayerX: A Cross-Platform Deep Learning Framework

TensorLayerX is a powerful, platform-agnostic deep learning framework that makes it easy to build and train deep learning models. With only one set of source code, it supports a variety of frameworks and chips, making it a versatile tool for developers.

## Quick Start

Get started with TensorLayerX quickly using the following examples:

- **MNIST Digit Recognition:** Train a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. Choose between a simple training method or custom loops. See the examples: [mnist_mlp_simple_train.py](https://github.com/tensorlayer/TensorLayerX/blob/main/examples/basic_tutorials/mnist_mlp_simple_train.py) and [mnist_mlp_custom_train.py](https://github.com/tensorlayer/TensorLayerX/blob/main/examples/basic_tutorials/mnist_mlp_custom_train.py).

- **CIFAR-10 Dataflow:** Learn how to create datasets, process images, and load data through DataLoader using the CIFAR-10 dataset. See the example: [cifar10_cnn.py](https://github.com/tensorlayer/TensorLayerX/blob/main/examples/basic_tutorials/cifar10_cnn.py).

- **MNIST GAN Training:** Train a generative adversarial network (GAN) on the MNIST dataset. See the example: [mnist_gan.py](https://github.com/tensorlayer/TensorLayerX/blob/main/examples/basic_tutorials/mnist_gan.py).

- **MNIST Mix Programming:** Mix TensorLayerX code with other deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Paddle, and MindSpore to run on the MNIST dataset. See the example: [mnist_mlp_mix_programming.py](https://github.com/tensorlayer/TensorLayerX/blob/main/examples/basic_tutorials/mnist_mlp_mix_programming.py).
